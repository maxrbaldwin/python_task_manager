# Fullstack Academy Simple Python Task Manager

## Getting Started
After pulling down the repo in the directory you can either use VSCode to make a virtual environment or use the following command
```sh
make environment
```
After the environment is made you can source the environment on Linux or Windows. This is the Linux command
```sh
source ./.venv/bin/activate
```
Now install dependencies
```sh
make requirements
```
Now you can run the app
```sh
make start
```
